====================================

<Settings>

This is the root object.

<GlobalColors>

Container of GlobalColor tags.  These contain PNG colors of common backgrounds.  The GlobalColors
tag SHOULD contain colors for at least these types: Sky, Water, Lava.

<GlobalColor>

Single tag with no children.  Properties are self-explanatory.

<Tiles>

Container of Tile tags.  These contain all of the tiles found in Terraria maps.  The Tiles tag
MUST contain Tile tags for all possible tiles that have a Tile_??.xnb file in the Terraria
game data, found in the Content\Images folder.

<Tile>

Single tile object; may contain Frame tags.  Has the following properties:

 * num         - Required; unique.  This tile number MUST match the same ID used in Terraria world files.     
 * color       - Required; default is #ffff00ff.  Color SHOULD approx. match the color of the tile in-game.
 * name        - Required; unique.  Name MUST match the tile name in-game, if possible.  (The
      TerrariaOnline wiki is a good source for information.)  Names MUST be unique among different
      Tile tags.  Names MAY be used as a tile identifier, so the names should be reasonably static.
      However, names that are discovered to not match the Terraria game name MUST be changed.

 * isSolid     - Required if true; default is false.  This property MUST be true if the tile can't
      be walked through.

 * isFramed    - Required if true; default is false.  This property MUST be true if the tile contains
      frames that require frame coordinates in Terraria world files.  This property MUST be accurate
      to read world files.  All tile types that use multiple tiles (tables, doors, chests, etc.)
      always have isFramed set, though some single-tiled objects also have frames.  Furthermore,
      some XNB tiles with frames actually don't need frame coordinations.  (Yes, it's confusing;
      it usually boils down to trial-and-error and seeing if the world file can't be read.)

 * size        - Required if not default; default is "1,1".  This is the width and height of tile
      objects that span multiple tiles.  If this property is beyond "1,1", then isFramed MUST be true.
      
 * placement   - Required if not default; default is "any".  This details how the tile (or full object,
      if multi-tiled) can be placed among other tiles.  The property MUST only be one of these options:
      
    @ any              - Is like a block, which can even float in the air
    @ floor            - Must be on the floor; affected by gravity
    @ surface          - Must be on top of a SolidTop surface object
    @ floorSurface     - Either "floor" or "surface"
    @ wall             - Must be attached to a tile-based wall (not a background wall)
    @ ceiling          - Must be attached to the ceiling
    @ wallFloor        - Either "wall" or "floor"
    @ wallFloorCeiling - Either "wall", "floor", or "ceiling" (rare; signs have these)
    @ CFBoth           - Must be attached to both ceiling AND floor (rare; doors have these)

 * isSolidTop  - Required if true; default is false.  If the object is a "Flat Surface" object, such
      as a table, this property MUST be set to true.  These objects will accept other objects that
      can be placed on top of surfaces, and can usually be stood on by the player, despite being a
      pass-through object itself.  In fact, isSolid and isSolidTop SHOULD be mutually exclusive.
      
 * growsOn     - Required if it applies.  This property only applies to plant objects (unless we
      happen to discover some sort of growing sword or other bizzare thing).  This property is a
      comma-delimited list of Tile numbers that will accept this object on top of it.  For example,
      grass flowers can only grow on grass blocks.  These type of tiles MUST only be able to have
      the following underneath it: the tiles on the list, itself (other tiles with the same tile
      number), or empty space.  Furthermore, the full plant object MUST ultimately have a
      bottom-most tile attached to one of the tiles on the list.
      
      All programs MUST NOT use the "placement" property (as an implied default or not) if a growOn
      property exists.  The "placement", "growsOn", and "hangsOn" properties are all mutually
      exclusive, and MUST NOT appear together on one Tile tag.

 * hangsOn     - Required if it applies.  This property is exactly like the growsOn property, except
      it applies for a required tile being _above_ the object, like vines.  All warnings about
      property exclusivity still apply.

 * canMixFrames - Required if true; default is false.  The "canMixFrames" property is true if the
      different Frame tags can swap around individual tiles for an object.  For example, a Pot is
      a 2x2 object with three different variations.  However, each 1x1 tile can be taken from a
      different variation to create a new composite object.  (Tiles must still be taken from the
      same location.  IOW, you can't take the lower-right corner of Pot A and use it for the
      upper-left corner of your new object.)  These type of objects are rare, as it only applies
      so far to Pots and Closed Doors.
 
      This property MUST NOT be used unless the "size" property is non-default, and "isFramed"
      property is true.

 * isHouseItem - Required if true; default is false.  If the object is one of the required objects
      that can be used to build a NPC-qualified house, this property MUST be true.  This should be
      used with other properties to identify all of the house objects:
      
    @ isSolidTop      - If true, then this classifies as a "Flat Surface" object for a house.
    @ lightBrightness - If non-zero, then this classified as a "Light Source" object for a house.
    @ None            - If the above two don't apply, then it's a "Comfort" object.

 * lightBrightness - Required if not default; default is 0.  This is the brightness of the light
      given off the object when placed, where 1.0 is torch light.  A non-zero value indicates 
      that this tile is a "Light Source", though objects such as Furnaces do qualify, even if it
      can't be used as a house "Light Source" object.
      
 * contactDmg  - Optional.  If the object causes damage when touched by the player, this is the
      amount of HP that it drains.

<Frames>

Container of Frame tags.  These contain all of the frame found for a individual Tile.  A Tile object
MUST contain a Frames tag, and the Frames tag MUST contain Frame tags for all possible tiles that
have isFramed set to true, with two exceptions:

 * If the Tile only has one Frame tag, the Frames/Frame tag SHOULD NOT appear.  Defaults for the frame
      are listed in the <Frame> spec.
      
 * The tags SHOULD NOT appear if the object is subject to auto-alignment or auto-correction by the game
      itself.  (For example, Signs automatically align to the right Frame, whether it's floor, wall, or
      ceiling, whereas Beds do not automatically pick a facing direction.)
 

<Frame>

Single frame object with no children.  Describes individual frames within a Tile image.

A Frame tag inherits all property information of its parent Tile tag.  So, all of the properties
of the Frame tag can exist in Tile tags and visa-versa.  Which means that all of the properties
on both tags are really optional as long as they appear on one or the other, with the following
exceptions:

 * The "num" property MUST appear on the Tile tag without question.
 * A Tile tag MUST have a name, even if it is later overridden by a Frame tag.
 * A Frame tag MUST have an "upperLeft" property, even if it's default.
 * A Frame tag MUST NOT have a isFramed property.  (This is just redundant.)
 * A Frame tag MUST NOT have a canMixFrames property.  (This doesn't even make sense.)
 * The following properties SHOULD only appear on Tile tags, as we have not found different ones
      on the same tile: isSolid, isSolidTop, size, placement, isHouseItem, lightBrightness,
      contactDmg

The following defaults are assumed for Frame tags, including Tiles with frames and no Frame tags:

 * The upperLeft property defaults to 0,0.
 * There are no "variety" or "dir" properties (unless set).
 * Each frame jumps by 18 frame points.  (So far this has been accurate for all multi-tile objects,
      so we don't need to create a new property yet...)

Frame tags MUST be ordered by a left-right reading direction.  So, all of the objects on the first
row, then the second, etc.  A zero-based num property can be assumed based on the order of the
object, but is not actually used (yet).

A Frame tag has the following (other) properties:
      
 * upperLeft - Required (even if default); default is 0,0. This is the X,Y coordinates of the
      upper-left corner of the Frame object. Frame coordinates directly relate to the Tile_??.xnb
      file referencing them. Each frame point is equal to 1/2 of a pixel. So, a X,Y of 18,0
      is starting at X,Y of 9,0 on the Tile image.
      
      A grand majority of tiles (including all multi-tiled objects) use 8x8 pixel tiles (with a
      1-pixel divider line), so all tiles are assumed to jump by 18 frame points. There are a few
      exceptions, but all of these tiles have size="1,1", so no jumping is required.
      
 * variety   - Optional as long as name+variety+dir is unique.  This further describes the object
      beyond what the name says.  For example, the in-game name of a normal wooden Chest is merely
      "Chest", but one frame has a locked Chest.  So, the name is "Chest", and the variety is 
      "Locked".
      
 * dir       - Optional as long as name+variety+dir is unique.  This is used instead of (or in
      combination with) a "variety" property to describe the facing direction of the object.  For
      example, a Toilet comes with both left- and right-facing versions.  This property MUST be
      a single character, which (so far) equals: l, r, u, c.  Which is Left, Right, Up, Center,
      respectively.  Down (as "d") may be used later on, so that is also acceptable.

Frame tags have a unique name among the name, variety, and dir properties.  So, they might be 
displayed in the following fashion:

<Frame upperLeft="22,0" name="Tree Trunk" dir="Up" variety="Right Indent A" />
   Full Name: Tree Trunk - Right Indent A (Upwards)

<Frame upperLeft="72,0" name="Gold Chest" variety="Locked" />
   Full Name: Gold Chest - Locked

<Frame upperLeft="18,0" name="Chair" dir="Right" />
   Full Name: Chair (Right Facing)

<Walls>

Container of Wall tags.  These contain all of the background walls found in Terraria maps.  The
Walls tag MUST contain Wall tags for all possible walls that have a Wall_??.xnb file in the Terraria
game data, found in the Content\Images folder.

<Wall>

Single wall, with no children.  Has the following properties:

 * num     - Required; unique.  This wall number MUST match the same ID used in Terraria world files.
 * name    - Required; unique.  Name MUST match the wall name in-game, if possible.
 * color   - Required.  Color SHOULD approx. match the color of the wall in-game.
 * isHouse - Required if true; default is false.  If true, this wall can be used in a house.

<Items>

Container of Item tags.  These contain all of the character items found in Terraria maps.  The Items
tag MUST contain Item tags for all possible items that have a Item_??.xnb file in the Terraria
game data, found in the Content\Images folder, as well as any other items found in the game that
can be picked up by the player.

<Item>

Single item; tag has no children.  Has the following properties:

 * num  - Required if exists; unique (if exists); starts with 0.  This item number MUST match the
      the same ID used in Terraria XNB image files.  For some reason, some items don't relate to
      an item ID, so certain items might not have one.  (There may be some palette shifting going
      on to reuse item image files...)
      
 * name - Required; unique.  Name MUST match the item name in-game.
      
 * type - Required except for the [empty] item.  This is a (loose) categorization of the item.
      The categories, so far, are somewhat subject to interpretation, and are pidgin-holed into
      a single category, but this will be more strictly defined in a future XML release.  The
      item type MUST be one of the categories (in all lowercase):
      
       @ tool       = All mining/gathering tools, like Pickaxe, Hammer, Axe, etc.
       @ weapon     = All weapons, including swords, staffs, consumable weapons (like Throwing Knives), etc.
       @ armor      = All items that fit into armor slot (including vanity; will split later on)
       @ vanity     = Future use for vanity (and useless) items.
       @ accessory  = All items that fit into accessory slots
       @ block      = Blocks that are normally gathered through mining
       @ light      = Items that are primarily used as a light source, ie: Torch, Candles, etc.
       @ storage    = All storage furniture, including Chests, Barrels, Trash Cans, etc.
       @ wall       = All background wall objects
       @ furniture  = All furniture, both decorative and crafting stations (will split later on)
       @ crafter    = Future use for crafting stations.
       @ plant      = All plants (supersedes all other categories)
       @ material   = Objects that are primarily used for crafting material
       @ potion     = All items called "Potion" or containers of liquid that buff character
       @ consumable = Other items that are one-use only
       @ ammo       = Objects that are primarily used for gun/bow ammo
       @ money      = Objects that go directly in the money slots
